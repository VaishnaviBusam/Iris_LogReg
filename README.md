# Iris Flower Classification using Logistic Regression

**Project Description:** To classify the Iris flowers into Iris-setosa, Iris-virginica, Iris-versicolor using the Kaggle dataset.
**Algorithm used:** Logistic Regression
**Reason for choosing Logistic Regression:** 
  1. Handles both binary and multiclass classification. Iris Dataset also has 3 classes which makes the dataset suitable for multinomial Logistic regression.
  2. Logistic regression gives probabilities as output for each class which makes it easier to understand.
  3. Logistic Regression is computationally efficient which makes it best suitable for small to moderately sized datasets like Iris.
  4. Iris dataset provides linear separability between Iris-setosa and other two classes. This linear separibility makes Logistic Regression to be well suited.
